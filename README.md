### Zohaib Ijaz

I am Principal Software Engineer working at Enquizit, Lahore. I am a full stack developer and feel awesome working with React and Python. I am passionate about coding best practices and love to learn new things, technologies and to share that knowledge.

Currently, I am focused on Javascript echo system and try to contribute in the form of open source github projects or npm packages in my free time.
